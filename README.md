# heapless
This is a research project aiming to explore functional programming languages which do not require a heap at run-time.

Project structure:
- `compiler` - The prototype implementation written in Haskell.
- `examples` - Examples of the language in action, doubling as a test suite for the compiler.
- `paper` - Research whitepaper describing the approach.
